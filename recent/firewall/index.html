                    <!-- <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked on the UX of firewall polices and rules while working at Infoblox, which offers SaaS enterprise products for 
                        IT automation and cybersecurity. I conducted user research by leveraging internal knowledge, I worked closely with 
                        product management to define UX requirements and took an iterative approach to designing the UX, reviewing mockups 
                        both internally and externally. <br />
                        <a href="#mockups">Skip to the mockups</a> 
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Longer Version</h3>
                    -->
                    <p>
                        Infoblox offers SaaS enterprise products for IT automation and cybersecurity. These products allow IT 
                        administrators to configure and manage servers that run software to enable DNS and DHCP services. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first product I worked on at Infoblox was designing software that runs on edge routers, the routers that 
                        operate at the edge of a corporate network and connect directly to an internet service provider. One of the many features 
                        of this product was a next generation firewall service. With this service installed on an Infoblox appliance, 
                        the customer could monitor and control all network traffic between their local network and the internet. The 
                        controlling of the traffic was done through firewall policies, which allow administrators to block specific types 
                        of traffic based on a set of rules. Some common use cases for firewall policies are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="semi">Blocking inappropriate content</strong> - 
                        Example: Per company policy employees are not allowed to watch Netflix, Hulu or other streaming services on the company network</li> 
                        <li><strong class="semi">Blocking malicious servers</strong> - 
                        Example: Blocking internet traffic both to and from IP addresses that are known to be associated with malware or spyware</li> 
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next generation firewall service was part of a larger product (a SASE product to be specific) that 
                        I worked on for a year and a half, but, unfortunately, was canceled when new management came 
                        into the company and decided the it was in a market Infoblox did not want to compete in. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started working as the designer for the product this next generation firewall feature was a part of the 
                        first week I was employed at Infoblox. I had only a basic understanding of networking, but I learned fast. 
                        This new product was being developed as a startup within Infoblox - and, because I have a lot of experience 
                        working at startups, I was able to hit the ground running. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The product manager had never worked with a designer before. He and I worked together to define the UX 
                        requirements for the firewall feature and other features of the product, such as the configuration of port 
                        forwarding, routing protocols and site- to- site VPN connections. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since software engineering work was already underway, there was little time to conduct any formal research. I relied 
                        heavily on internal company knowledge. I met with several groups within Infoblox to gather information and review design concepts.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Product Management</strong> - The product manager for this new product had worked as a network engineer for many years and had extensive 
                                experience configuring firewalls</li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Infoblox's own IT staff</strong> - I met repeatedly with members of Infoblox's IT staff who configured firewalls as part of their job</li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Technical Advisory Board</strong> - The product manager and I reviewed the overall approach of using policies and rules with a technical advisory board that comprised IT admins from several of Infoblox's customers.</li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Competitive Reviews</strong> - I reviewed competing products to get an understanding of what the existing UX conventions were for this type of 
                                administration software</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Problem Statements</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goals for the firewall policy feature were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In competing products, typically firewall rules require the user know a lot of information up front, i.e source and/or destination IP, port and protocol</li> 
                            <li>IT administrators at small to medium size companies may not have a lot of experience or training setting up firewall rules</li> 
                            <li>Applying rules to many edge routers can be tedious and repetitive </li> 
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goals for the firewall policy feature were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firewall rules should be grouped into Firewall Policies, for easier management</li> 
                            <li>A Firewall Policy should be deployable to many Infoblox Appliances (create once, deploy everywhere)</li> 
                            <li>The UX should be easy to use for IT administrators without much experience creating firewall rules</li> 
                            <li>Infoblox should aid the user by providing lists of common destinations to allow or deny, but still provide more expert settings</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Infoblox has a UI pattern and component system that all their products are based on and I was required to stay within those existing patterns 
                        and components. On the one hand, this meant I could go straight to designing high fidelity mockups, using the UX team's Adobe XD UI kit. On 
                        the other hand, it meant that updating or creating new components was out of scope. One exception was a stepped process pattern that 
                        I was able to update to allow users to create firewall rules within a firewall policy (creating a nested object inside another object).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I sought feedback on my design work in several ways. I reviewed my designs with internal stakeholders including many of the same people I 
                        talked to when conducting my research, product managers, engineering managers and internal IT staff. I also conducted an unmoderated user 
                        test on UserTesting.com of the new stepped process UX pattern, which the design successfully passed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Wireframes</h4> 
                    <p>
                        In order to maintain the confidentiality of the work, the designs shown here are not the actual mockups created for this project. 
                        What's presented here are wireframes that demonstrate a similar approach to solving the same problems.
                    </p>
