                    <h2>Firewall Policies and Rules</h2>
                    <p>
                        Infoblox offers SaaS enterprise products for IT automation and cybersecurity. These products allow IT 
                        administrators to configure and manage servers that run software to enable DNS and DHCP services. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company decided to expand its product offering to include a next generation firewall service. 
                        With this servics installed on an Infoblox server, the customer could monitor and control all 
                        network traffic between their local network and the internet. The controlling of the traffic was 
                        done through firewall policies, which allow administrators to block specific types of 
                        traffic based on a set of rules. Some common use cases for firewall policies are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="semi">Blocking inappropriate content</strong> - 
                        Example: Per company policy employees are not allowed to watch Netflix, Hulu or other streaming services on the company network</li> 
                        <li><strong class="semi">Blocking malicious servers</strong> - 
                        Example: Blocking internet traffic both to and from IP addresses that are known to be associated with malware or spyware</li> 
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next generation firewall service was part of a larger product (a SASE product to be specific) that 
                        I worked on for a year and a half, but, unfortunately, was canceled when new management came 
                        into the company and decided the it was in a market Infoblox did not want to compete in. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started working as the designer for the product this next generation firewall feature was a part of the 
                        first week I was employed at Infoblox. I had only a basic understanding of networking, but I learned fast. 
                        This new product was being developed as a startup within Infoblox - and, because I have a lot of experience 
                        working at startups, I was able to hit the ground running. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The product manager had never worked with a designer before. He and I worked together to define the UX 
                        requirements for the firewall feature and other features of the product, such as the configuration of port 
                        forwarding, routing protocols and site- to- site VPN connections. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goals for the firewall policy feature were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The firewall policy feature was geared towards IT admins at small- to medium-sized companies 
                                where the admin might not be an expert at networking</li> 
                            <li>The feature needed to allow administrators to define what internet traffic is allowed or denied and for whom (or what device)</li> 
                            <li>A policy, defined as a groups of rules, should be deployable to many Infoblox Appliances (create once, deploy everywhere)</li> 
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I joined the project, software engineering work was already underway. There was little time to conduct any formal research. I relied 
                        heavily on internal company knowledge. I met with several groups within Infoblox to gather information and review design concepts.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Product Management</strong> - The product manager for this new product had worked as a network engineer for many years and had extensive 
                                experience configuring firewalls</li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Infoblox's own IT staff</strong> - I met repeatedly with members of Infoblox's IT staff who configured firewalls as part of their job</li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Technical Advisory Board</strong> - The product manager and I reviewed the overall approach of using policies and rules with a technical advisory board that comprised IT admins from several of Infoblox's customers.</li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Competitive Reviews</strong> - I reviewed competing products to get an understanding of what the existing UX conventions were for this type of 
                                administration software</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-5">
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Infoblox has a UI pattern and component system that all their products are based on and I was required to stay within those existing patterns 
                        and components. On the one hand, this meant I could go straight to designing high fidelity mockups, using the UX team's Adobe XD UI kit. On 
                        the other hand, it meant that updating or creating new components was out of scope. One exception was a stepped process pattern that 
                        I was able to update to allow users to create firewall rules within a firewall policy (creating a nested object inside another object).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I sought feedback on my design work in several ways. I reviewed my designs with internal stakeholders including many of the same people I 
                        talked to when conducting my research, product managers, engineering managers and internal IT staff. I also conducted an unmoderated user 
                        test on UserTesting.com of the new stepped process UX pattern, which the design successfully passed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Wireframes</h4> 
                    <p>
                        In order to maintain the confidentiality of the work, the designs shown here are not the actual mockups created for this project. 
                        What's presented here are wireframes that demonstrate a similar approach to solving the same problems.
                    </p>
