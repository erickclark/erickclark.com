                    <h2>Network Asset Inventory Software </h2>
                    <p>
                        Infoblox offers SaaS enterprise products for IT automation and cybersecurity. Infoblox's senior management spotted an opportunity to 
                        develop a new product that would provide detailed information about the devices (also known as assets) on their customers' networks, 
                        both in the cloud and on- premises. The purpose of this new product is for incident response and auditing. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was the lead designer for this project, working with a less- senior designer, two product managers and an engineering team. 
                        I designed a first draft of the UX for network discovery, the process of scanning both on-premises and cloud networks to gather 
                        asset data. Next, I handed that off to the less-senior designer to complete under my supervision while I worked on the asset 
                        inventory UX. Neither of the product managers I collaborated with had worked with a designer before, which meant I had to educate them 
                        on the design process and define the UX requirements for this new product.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        The software would allow customers to import and view detailed information about:
                        <ul>
                            <li>On-premises assets: Laptops, printers, WiFi security cameras, any connected device</li> 
                            <li>Cloud assets: virtual servers, load balancers, network gateways, any asset living in a cloud platform like AWS, 
                                Azure or Google Cloud Platform</li> 
                        </ul>
                        Requirements for the new software product included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Summary data should be made available to provide insights into the customers' network assets</li>
                            <li>Asset data should be searchable, sortable and filterable</li>
                            <li>An MVP needed to be delivered in four months </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    The use cases that needed to be addressed in the new product included:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="semi">Troubleshooting and Incident Response</strong> - 
                            Example: an IP address has been identified sending network traffic to an internet server associated with malware. Admins need a tool 
                            for looking up what devices that IP address has been assigned to and when, and where those devices are located</li>
                        <li><strong class="semi">Auditing</strong> - 
                            Example: Determining attack surface by compiling a list of devices that have out of date operating systems or are known to be easily hacked (IoT)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Given the short amount of time I had to work with, no generative research was conducted instead relying on internal knowledge and 
                        reviews of competing products. I met with several groups within Infoblox to gather information and review design concepts.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Product Management</strong> -
                                One of the product managers had previously been the head of IT at ExxonMobil. His boss had been worked as a Network Engineer at 
                                Apple for many years
                            </li>
                            <li><strong class="semi">Infoblox's own IT staff</strong> -
                                The company's own network engineers and administrators provided valuable insight into what they saw as necessary features</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong class="semi">Infoblox's Professional Services Team</strong> -
                                Subject matter experts who have worked in IT and possess an in depth knowledge of the pain points of Infoblox's customers
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        My process for creating the design of the asset inventory software was iterative. I worked within the limitations of Infoblox's 
                        existing pattern and component system. This meant that I could quickly put together high fidelity mockups by leveraging the UX team's existing 
                        UI kit, but due to time constraints, I couldn't update or create new patterns and components. I set up weekly review meetings 
                        with product managers, SMEs and key members of the engineering team to brainstorm and get feedback. Features I designed were broken up 
                        into feature stories by the product managers, as part of the Scaled Agile Framework process. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The design mockups were tested to both evaluate the usability of the UX and to gather feedback about potential gaps in functionality. 
                        I worked with a UX researcher to write the test plan and the researcher conducted the test. The lessons learned from testing were 
                        incorporated into the product road map.

                    <h3>Process Flows</h3> 
                    The functionality required for the asset inventory system includes both the import of the data, referred to as Asset Discovery, and 
                	viewing of summary and detailed data about assets on a customer's networks. Users are also required to create sets of credentials to allow the
                	discovery process to communicate with the cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). The process diagrams shown here represent the high level
                    process flows for the three processes.

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3> 
                    <p>
                        For the sake of this presentation, I've focused on the Dashboard and Inventory screens from the process flows above. In order to 
                        maintain the confidentiality of the work, the designs shown here are not the actual mockups created for this project. What's 
                        presented here are wireframes that demonstrate a similar approach to solving the same problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Dashboard</h4>
                        The dashboard provides summary information about the assets in the system and has a "View" menu to switch between the All Assets View, 
                        Cloud View and On-Prem View. From my discussions with the many stakeholders and SMEs I talked to, I learned that many network 
                        administrators specialize in either on-prem or cloud. This menu allowed users to filter the data to only on-prem or cloud KPIs and 
                        widgets. Each KPI and widget leads the user into the Inventory section, with filters put in place based on what the user clicked on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Inventory</h4>
                        The Inventory section shows the asset data as a table, with options to search, sort, filter and download the data. The "View" dropdown 
                        menu is available at the top here as well. Filtering is an important part of the UX, as the main use cases for this software are to 
                        either find a single asset or generate a list of assets. Users can filter based on the table column headers as well as other relevant 
                        asset attributes or enter a plain text search into the filter area which would search on all the attributes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Details View</h4>
                        A details panel of an asset is available when the user clicks on a table row. The slide-out panel allows users to click on one asset name 
                        after another and quickly learn the full set of attributes of each asset.
