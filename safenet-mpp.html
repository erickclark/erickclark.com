                    <h2>MobilePASS+ Health Dashboard Design </h2>
                    <p>
                        I worked as a lead UX designer on the Identity and Access Management team at Thales Gemalto. This team
                        produced and maintained a cloud-based access management and authentication service called SafeNet Trusted
                        Access. This software is used by IT administrators to control how and what employees could access inside a
                        company network and set rules for multi-factor authentication. MobilePASS+ is the authenticator mobile app
                        (similar to Google Authenticator or Duo Authenticator) used with SafeNet Trusted Access. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked as the designer on this project. The process of designing these screens was iterative and involved
                        discussions with the product owner followed by several reviews with him, other stakeholders, and members of the
                        design team.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                    <p>The MobilePASS+ authenticator mobile app collects key information about the devices it's installed on for security
                    purposes. This information includes OS type and version and whether the OS has been jail-broken or rooted.
                    Mobile devices that are jail-broken or rooted might allow hackers to compromise the integrity of the app and
                    those devices are also more susceptible to malware and viruses. Though the data was collected by the app it was
                    not sent back to SafeNet Trusted Access. The app was updated to change that, and additional screens needed to be
                    added to SafeNet Trusted Access to display that information.</p>
                    The use cases that needed to be addressed in the new screens were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The IT admin needs to know high level information about the number and type of mobile devices on the
                        company network, so they know how many resources to devote to supporting those devices.</li>
                        <li>The IT admin also needs to know the number of jail-broken or rooted devices on the company network, so the
                        admin has a general view of the security of the network as it pertains to mobile devices.</li>
                        <li>The IT admin also needs to be able to view information about individual users and devices to determine if
                         MobilePASS+ should be disabled or suspended on a device.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Normally I would have conducted customer interviews to better understand the problems this project was attempting to solve, 
                        but I don't always have the luxury to do that due to time constraints. For this project I relied on the  
                        product owner's and internal SME's knowledge of the customers' wants and needs.

                    <h3>Process Flows </h3>
                    <p>Shown below are high level process flows that show how the four established personas (End User, Help Desk,
                        Chief Information Security Office (CISO) and the Product Owner) would interact with the planned updates to
                        MobilePASS+ and SafeNet Trusted Access. The dashboard screens shown in this document apply largely to the
                        process flows for the CISO and Product Owner.

                    <h3>Initial Designs </h3>
                    <p>
                        Leveraging Safenet's design system, my initial solution was to create a dashboard system. SafeNet Trusted Access has a single high-level dashboard
                        that shows login activity. I added a menu to the top of the dashboard screen that would allow users to switch
                        between the existing dashboard and the new MobilePASS+ Health dashboard. The information shown on the first
                        screen provides some context about app installations over time along with OS and jail-broken or rooted status. The
                        purpose of this information is to give IT admins a view of the overall health of the mobile devices on their network.
                        The column on the right shows most recently active users with jail-broken or rooted devices for the purpose of
                        troubleshooting users who are having trouble logging in.</p>

                    <h4>Final Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        This design concept presented the user with high level stats about the mobile devices on the customer's network
                        while also showing granular data about the devices and their users. This made the information more actionable
                        in terms of disabling or suspending an individual's app. I added search and filtering functionality and an option to
                        export the data for use with mass email (to request that users un-jailbreak or un-root their phone.) After reviewing
                        each design concept with stakeholders, members of the design team and members of the software development
                        team, this design was chosen to move forward with.
